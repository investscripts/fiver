I'm looking to create a very simple one page website similar to https://mmafightcards.org.  I obviously do not want an exact copy - I'd like to see some of your creative improvements and ideas based on the reviews you have it looks like you're very talented!    Here are the details and "must haves":

1.  All text should be able to be modified easily with a text editor. I need to be able to easily update new schedules, names, dates, urls, etc etc. As long as I can edit with a text editor that will be fine. 

2. Each name (fighter) should be a clickable link - > The URL I'll edit - but for now you can use https://www.tapology.com/fightcenter/fighters/14607-conor-mcgregor for all links

3. The website I gave you as an example only shows one league's schedule and that league is called "UFC" however there are 2 other leagues I'd like to have (that's how this page you create will be different than the website I provided as an example)
  - 
UFC, Bellator, and One

(If possible I'd like to have it so that I can easily add/remove a new league in the future)

3a. I should be able to click on the league name somewhere at the top of the page and have that league's schedule show up on the same page - in other words, the new schedule shows up on the same page - it should not take me to another page but rather stay "in place".   The idea is that everything is accessible on the same page - keeping the site simple to use.

4. The schedule should appear on the right hand side - but please use creativity in how it's displayed. I prefer a divided page vertically but will look to you to make it.

5. I'd like the icon for the UFC logo to be the picture I uploaded called - ufclogo

6. I'd like the icon for the Bellator logo to be the picture I uploaded called - bellatorlogo

7. I'd like the icon for the One log to be the picture I uploaded called - one logo


8. The right side of the page should be a list of upcoming fights and they should have a different color when hovering or any other nice effect you feel would look good.


9. Right now on the mmacards.org site there are two sides to the page( middle and right sides - the left side is just the grey background color)  I'd like three sides where:

9a. The left side of the page I want you to use your creativity to create a social media section. I should be able to post videos or links to fighter's social media pages. Please use your imagination to make it look great!

10. I don't need a search feature. 

11. I don't need a settings feature.

12. I'd like a way to share the site on social media.
